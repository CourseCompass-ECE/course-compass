# Course Compass
#### Meta University Capstone Project
#### By Dante Capobianco

## Overview
University of Toronto Computer & Electrical Engineering students face strict, complex requirements during course selection which leads to significant time spent exploring various course selection options, time wasted solving course, minor/certificate & degree conflicts, and often mistakes where conflicts are not identified or interest in courses was not judged appropriately. This solution aims to centralize & simplify the course selection process through an all-in-one course exploration & timetable planning system with built-in recommendation tools to find students conflict-free timetables that truly meet their needs.
